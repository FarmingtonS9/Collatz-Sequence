# Collatz-Sequence
Simple Collatz Sequence program based on Collatz' Conjecture.
The algorithm is simple. The conjecture states, no matter the positive integer chosen, the number should always return to 1 following the algorithm.
Rules:
- If even, divide the number by 2. E.g: n / 2
- Else odd, times the number by 3, then plus 1. E.g: n * 3 + 1
